            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <strong>How much does it cost to get a card?</strong>
            <p>All Rowan students are billed $10 for their first RowanCard. Replacement cards can be purchased for $25
                at the Chamberlain Student Center Information Desk.</p>
            <strong>How do I apply additional funds to my RowanCard?</strong>
            <p>Students cannot add Dining Dollars to their accounts, however, students, faculty, and staff can add 
            money to their 'Boro Bucks account. To do so, you must first have your Rowan ID made at the Information
            Desk in order to activate your account. The fastest way to add funds is online through Banner Self-Service
            using financial aid credit or a credit card. Once you have logged in, select Bursar Services then select
            "Buy Boro Bucks" and follow the instructions. Please remember you need to have gotten your RowanCard prior
            to adding funds. Family and relatives can make a guest deposit to a student's RowanCard by logging into
            eAccounts and select guest deposit. A guest deposit will require the person to know the first and last name
            of the student and their Rowan ID number.</p>

            <strong>Can I let someone borrow my card?</strong>
            <p>Rights and privileges associated with the card are non-transferable. Students, faculty, and staff should not 
            lend their cards to friends or give them any passwords associated with the card accounts. You will be held 
            accountable for all financial and business transactions conducted with their RowanCard.</p>

            <p>Students, faculty, and staff should always carry their RowanCard with them as proof of who they are and their 
            affiliation with the university.</p>

            <strong>What if I find someone else's card?</strong>
            <p>Found cards should be returned to the Student Center Information Desk, just outside of the MarketPlace, or call 
            856-256-GONE for further instructions. Attempting to use a lost/stolen card, for any purpose, can be considered theft.</p>

            <strong>Who is eligible?</strong>
            <p>The RowanCard is required for all Rowan students, faculty and staff as their identification card.</p>

            <strong>If I'm on a meal plan can I still use the RowanCard?</strong>
            <p>Absolutely! You can draw upon four accounts when using the RowanCard—the Meal Plan, Dining Dollars account, 'Boro Bucks 
            account, and the Meal SV account (block plan holders only). Please be aware that Dining Dollars can only be used for food 
            purchases on-campus and at select Rowan Boulevard food locations. 'Boro Bucks can be used for food as well as any other 
            purchase wherever the RowanCard is accepted. Meal SV transactions can be used at selected Rowan Blvd. merchants.</p>

            <strong>How do I open my 'Boro Bucks account?</strong>
            <p>Every person who is issued a RowanCard also has the option of using his or her RowanCard 'Boro Bucks. There is no need to 
            “open” this account, simply make a deposit and then use your card at any of the participating merchants. Not sure on how 
            to make a deposit? <a href="/account.php"></a>Click here</a>.</p>

            <strong>How do I close my account?</strong>
            <p>The funds in the 'Boro Bucks Account automatically roll over from one semester to the next and year to year. You may request
            to close your 'Boro Bucks account at the end of any academic year by completing the close-out form and submitting it to the
            Bursar's Office. Upon withdrawal from school or termination of employment, the RowanCard 'Boro Bucks account will be closed and
            a refund will be issued for balances over $10.00. Graduating students with balances over $10.00 will receive a refund check.</p>
